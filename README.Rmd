Read microtiter plate data exported from [Molecular Devices](https://www.moleculardevices.com) [SoftMax Pro](https://www.moleculardevices.com/systems/microplate-readers/softmax-pro-7-software).


## Installation

softermax is not quite ready to be available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org), but you can use [devtools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) to install the current development version:

```r
    if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("briandconnelly/softermax")
```


## Usage

To start working with your plate data in R, we'll first export the data as an XML file from SoftMax Pro.


### Exporting Plate Data as XML

With your experiment file open, select **Export** from the Main Menu.

![](README-images/main_menu.png)

Now, from the Export dialog, select either a single plate (orange butterfly) or all of the plates (blue raindrop) from your experiment.
Then, select **XML** under *Output Format* (green ghost), and hit the **OK** button.

![](README-images/export_details.png)

Choose your file name, and you're all set.


### Importing Data into R

The `read_softmax_xml` function can read XML files exported by SoftMax Pro.
Just supply the name of the file that you saved.

```{r}
    library(softermax)

    d <- read_softmax_xml("crystal_violet_dilutions.xml")
```

The variable `d` is an object that contains information about your experiment.
Most importantly, `d$plates` is a list where each element is a data frame (actually a [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble)) with information about each well in that plate.
For this example data, there is only one plate.
Let's take a look at the first ten rows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
    head(d$plates[[1]], n = 10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
    knitr::kable(head(d$plates[[1]], n = 10), format = "markdown")
```


### Plotting the Data

Since this was a *static read*, we can quickly make a plot of the readings for each well.
First, I'll add Row and Column values for each well.

```{r message=FALSE}
    library(dplyr)
    library(microtiterr)

    platedata <- d$plates[[1]] %>%
        mutate(Row = well_row(Well), Column = well_column(Well))
```


Here, I'll use `theme_bdc_microtiter` from the [ggplot2bdc](https://github.com/briandconnelly/ggplot2bdc) package to make the output look like a 96-well microtiter plate.



```{r Static Plot}
    library(ggplot2)
    library(ggplot2bdc)

    ggplot(data = platedata, aes(x = Column, y = Row, color = Value)) +
        geom_point(data = expand.grid(Column = seq(1,12), Row = seq(1,8)),
                   color = "grey90", fill = "white", shape = 21, size = 8) +
        geom_point(size = 9) +
        coord_fixed(ratio = (13/12)/(9/8), xlim = c(0.5, 12.5), ylim = c(0.6, 8.4)) +
        scale_y_reverse(breaks = seq(1, 8), labels = LETTERS[1:8]) +
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12), position = "top") +
        scale_color_continuous(name = "OD595") +
        labs(title = "Plate Layout for My Experiment", subtitle = "5 April 2017") +
        theme_bdc_microtiter()
    

```
